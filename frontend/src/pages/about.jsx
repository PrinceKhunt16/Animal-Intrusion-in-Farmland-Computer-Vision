                Our Voice-Activated Deterrent System is designed to prevent wild animal intrusion in farmland areas, ensuring the safety of crops and livestock. Using advanced machine learning, our model is trained to detect and identify animals commonly found in agricultural settings, such as Buffalo, Cattle, Deer, Dog, Fox, Pig, Sheep, and Wolf. These specific animals have been selected due to their frequent presence in farmland environments, making this system particularly effective in monitoring and managing potential threats.
